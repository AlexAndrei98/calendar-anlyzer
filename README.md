# calendar-anlyzer

This project is meant for me to track my schedule on Google Calendar and my habits so that I can improve upon them.
In this repo I will use the MyFitnessPal API to get my food as well as the `google-calendar-python` package to interact with ti.

The label of the events are in color_activity.py which should be personalized.
